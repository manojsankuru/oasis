`python -m src.test_api` check 3 returned FAIL once, immediately after eight
consecutive passes of the same check with no code change in between:

```
3. tool calling
  no tool_calls returned; this server may not support function calling
  FAIL
```

Not reproducible. A direct 8-run probe of the same prompt and the same single-tool
spec against `google/gemini-2.5-pro` on the Vertex OpenAI-compatible endpoint
returned a tool call 8/8 times. Observed rate is therefore roughly 1 miss in 10,
not a capability gap — the model occasionally answers from parametric knowledge
instead of calling the offered tool.

Consequence for the build: a single-shot check of "does this backend support tool
calling" can report a false negative. Any future gate that turns on one tool-call
observation should run it more than once before concluding. It also sets a floor
on agent reliability that the S10 sandbox instrumentation and the S12 fault runs
should measure rather than assume: an occasional silent no-call is a different
failure shape from an error, because nothing raises.

Not fixed. Recorded so the number is honest when the paper reports repair rates.

## 2026-08-28 — keyless Census API answers HTTP 200 with an HTML page (S3)

`config.setting_warnings()` claimed the Census API "allows keyless use up to a
daily cap". Measured, it does not:

```
GET https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5?get=NAME,B01003_001E&for=tract:*&in=state:45 county:019
200  Content-Type: text/html
<html ...><title>Missing Key</title>
```

The status is 200 and the content type is HTML, so `raise_for_status()` passes
and `.json()` is where it finally fails, several frames away from the cause.
`docs/DATA.md` section 3 had it right; the warning string in `config.py` was
wrong and has been corrected.

This is the second member of the same family found today, after the ArcGIS error
body served with HTTP 200 in section 1. Both services signal failure in the body
and success in the status line. The retrieval layer therefore treats content type
and body shape as part of the success condition, not the status code alone --
which is a paper point, not just a bug fix.

Consequence for the build: S4 cannot start until CENSUS_API_KEY is set.

**Resolved later on 2026-08-28 (S4).** A key was set and still returned the same
HTML page, this time titled `Invalid Key` rather than `Missing Key` — a newly
issued key does nothing until it is activated from its confirmation email, and
the two states are indistinguishable from the status line. Once activated the
same request returned 99 rows of JSON. The guard stayed: `_census_get` raises a
message naming `CENSUS_API_KEY` for either title, and `--check` deliberately
sends a mangled key to prove that path still fires. The wasted time was spent
deciding whether the key or the code was wrong, which is the argument for the
error message naming the setting rather than saying "expected JSON".
